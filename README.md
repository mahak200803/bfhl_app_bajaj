Backend
Objective:
Build and deploy a REST API with one endpoint that accepts requests with both GET and POST methods.

Frontend
Objective:
Develop and deploy a frontend application that uses the backend you’ve developed to process the input and 
get response, then render it on frontend. (Preferably React based – including frameworks like Next.js, but 
that’s optional).
